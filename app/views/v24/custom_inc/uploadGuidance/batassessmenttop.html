<p>For BAT that you’re proposing to follow, you must explain how you’re going to either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <li>follow the BAT conclusions and meet the BAT-associated emissions level (for BAT that are contained in BAT conclusions)</li>
  <li>follow the best available technique reference (BREF) note and the technical guidance for activities that don’t have BAT conclusions</li>

</ul>

<p>For any BAT you’re not going to follow, you must propose an alternative technique.</p>
