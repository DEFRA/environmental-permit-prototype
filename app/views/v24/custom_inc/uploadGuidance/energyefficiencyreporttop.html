    Your report should show how your MCP meets the requirements of Schedule 24 of the Environmental Permitting Regulations which implement the relevant requirements of the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU).

    If you believe that Schedule 24 does not apply to your case, you should upload a document explaining your reasons.
