<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/technical-guidance-for-regulated-industry-sectors-environmental-permitting" target="_blank">Read the technical guidance (opens new tab)</a> for each activity you are applying for.</li>
    <li>Using the technical guidance, develop a full set of proposals for your operations, especially about your operationâ€™s foreseeable emissions to air, water and land.</li>
    <li>Create an assessment to describe the risks posed by your proposals, following the methods set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/risk-assessments-for-your-environmental-permit" target="_blank">risk assessments for your environmental permit (opens new tab)</a>.</li>
